## How to run

The project runs completely inside docker with the help of docker-compose <br>
To build simply call
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

However you will find that this does not work 100% out of the box since it's missing enviromental secrets

Simply edit the .env file and fill in the secrets

## Notes
There is a quite a bit of unused code in the project currenlty. All of this code was written at some point for testing or to be reimplemented after submission (or during submission for demonstration purposes)

For example there is a login option for google that is currently unused
